# How to get it working:

1. To run the webapp just go to cmd and run python ntpFinal.py
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48627530/54487729-614e8500-48bf-11e9-892e-a300d0780db6.JPG)

2. Just copy paste the localhost http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and you can see the following page 

3. Here you need to enter the user name 

4. Then you need to upload the image and you can see that it starts detecting brands 

5. Also you can view the statistics just to see the percentage of each brand location wise 

6. You can enter your mail id and you can see that the statistics have been set on your mail.

7. Also the user can give the feedback and if the feedback given by the user regarding the image is not what the prediction shows then 
that image would be added to the train folder and the next time when model gets trained that image is included in the training



# Integration:
